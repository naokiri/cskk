* Rules overview

libcskk will support various typing rules in the future
which define keyboard shortcuts and array-of-keys to kana conversion table.
Rules are normally read from xdg data directory's libcskk/rules,
which defaults to ~/.local/share/libcskk/rules as top priority and then searches $XDG_DATA_DIRES/libcskk/rules/

See rules/metadata.toml and rules/default/rule.toml for example and definition.
